# Capstone Project — Initial Report & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Organization
- **Notebook:** `notebooks/capstone_eda_baseline.ipynb`
- **Data:** place your dataset file inside `data/` (e.g., `data/dataset.csv`)
- **Requirements:** `requirements.txt`

## Problem Statement (fill this in)
Write your research question in 1–3 sentences.

Example:
> Can we predict customer churn using demographic + usage behavior features?

## Dataset (fill this in)
- **Source:** (link / provider / course dataset)
- **Rows / Columns:** (after loading)
- **Target variable:** (name + meaning)
- **Feature summary:** (key columns)

## Data Cleaning Summary (fill this in)
- Missing values: (dropped / imputed + how)
- Duplicates: (removed count)
- Outliers: (what you found + how you handled)
- Feature engineering: (new columns + encodings)

## EDA Highlights (fill this in)
- Most important distributions:
- Strongest correlations / relationships:
- Key insights relevant to your research question:

## Baseline Model
- **Model:** (e.g., Logistic Regression / Linear Regression)
- **Metric:** (Accuracy / F1 / RMSE / R²)
- **Rationale:** why this metric fits your problem & class balance

## Results (fill this in)
- Train metric:
- Test metric:
- Interpretation (2–5 sentences):

## Next Steps (Module 24)
- Try additional models (Random Forest / XGBoost / SVM / etc.)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Better feature engineering
- Communicate findings for non-technical audience
